            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">I am a student double majoring in Computer Science and Technical Communication at Iowa State University.
                I'm passionate about exploring the intersections between technology and human experience to create user-friendly software.
                I'm currently the webmaster for the Digital Women Club at ISU, where I manage and maintain our website. 
                I'm also involved with the Girls Who Code Club and the Computer Science and Software Engineering Club, 
                where I enjoy collaborating with others and learning more about the field.</p>
            <p>I have been on the Dean's List for several semesters and am a proud member of the ISU Honors Program. 
                Outside of academics, I love music and enjoy playing the clarinet, alto saxophone, and piano. 
                I also enjoy doing arts and crafts, reading, and listening to music. 
                Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and work on ways to mix technology and communication.</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to developing a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists of
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top known as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourselves and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourselves and the second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>
